P5NCI
=====

0.20 - Tue May  9 07:53:06 UTC 2006

P5NCI provides a means of loading shared libraries and calling their functions
from Perl without writing any glue code -- or compiling any XS, besides what
you compile when you install this module.

Version 0.20 adds support for sending and receiving opaque pointers to and from NCI functions.  Don't modify them.  They're opaque.

INSTALLATION

To install this module:

   $ perl Build.PL
   $ perl ./Build
   $ perl ./Build test
   $ sudo ./Build install

You can also use the Makefile, though I don't recommend it.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	DynaLoader (core, to run)

	Math::BaseCalc       (to build, no kidding)
	Module::Builder      (to build)
	ExtUtils::CBuilder   (to build)

	Test::Simple    0.47 (to test)
	Test::Exception 0.19 (to test)
